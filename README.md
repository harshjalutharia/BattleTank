# BattleTank
Unreal Engine Game Project where Player will control a tank on a battlefield

# IMPORTANT NOTE:
This game was made using Unreal Engine 4.22 which has a lot of bugs. This game is finished however bugs like disappearing actor components, duplicating components, removal of component settings etc. have rendered the game unplayable at this time. Upgrading to a newer engine version will probably require remaking most of the stuff again which I can't be bothered to do. So, this game will just remain in this broken state, as a view to where I started my game development journey.
